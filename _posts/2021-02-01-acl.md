## Abstract

Language generation models’ democratization benefits many domains, from answering health-related questions to enhancing education by providing AI-driven tutoring services. However, language generation models’ democratization also makes it easier to generate human-like text at-scale for nefarious activities, from spreading misinformation to targeting specific groups with hate speech. Thus, it is essential to understand how people interact with bots and develop methods to detect bot-generated text. This paper shows that bot-generated text detection methods are more robust across datasets and models if we use information about how people respond to it rather than using the bot’s text directly. We also analyze linguistic alignment, providing insight into differences between humanhuman and human-bot conversations.
