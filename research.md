## What do I do?
Broadly speaking, my primary research interests involve biomedical and social applications of natural language processing.


## Public-Health, Social Media, and Bias

Social media platforms, such as Twitter, are used for many health-related applications, including, but not limited to, the early detection of disease outbreaks, monitoring adverse drug reactions, behavioral risk surveillance (such as monitoring smoking/drug use), and mining individuals mental and physical health.  While many systems have achieved high overall accuracy, it is not enough to decide whether to deploy the systems into production or to use the predictions for public health-related policy development. If a system is evaluated on the racial majority, it may achieve 90% accuracy. However, the performance on underrepresented groups may be much lower. Unfortunately, evaluating fairness is non-trivial. Many fairness metrics require the demographics to be known, or at least, inferred. It is hard to estimate fairness for groups that do not appear in the training dataset. Moreover, many datasets are not large enough to contain every minority group. Hence, much of my recent work has focused on socia media data, public health, and associated issues of bias and fairness.

## Biomedical NLP Applications
Language shapes the world we live in. Information is shared among individuals through verbal and written communication, including biomedical information. Doctors write notes describing patient symptoms, medical history, and diagnoses. The notes are used annotated by hospitals for billing purposes, e.g., <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2018/02/naacl"><b>medical coding</b></a>. Scientists write research articles creating new information, including, but not limited to, new <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2017/08/ichi"><b>drug-drug</b></a>, drug-gene, and <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2018/03/bioinformatics-2018"><b>gene-gene</b></a> interactions. On social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, users describe life events giving insight on the users mental and physical health, indicating possible <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2017/11/smmh"><b>adverse drug events</b></a>, depression, or PTSD. I develop methods that can extract biomedical information from many textual data sources.
