## What do I do?
Broadly speaking, my primary research interests involve biomedical and social applications of natural language processing.

## Language? Biomedical?
Language shapes the world we live in. Information is shared among individuals through verbal and written communication. Doctors write notes describing patient symptoms, medical history, and diagnoses. The notes are used for <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2018/02/naacl">medical coding</a>. Scientists write research articles creating new information, including, but not limited to, new drug-drug, drug-gene, and gene-gene interactions. On social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, users describe life events giving insight on the users mental health illnesses indicating possible <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2017/11/smmh">adverse drug events</a>. If we can learn I develop methods that can understand language and apply the methods to many biomedical problems.
