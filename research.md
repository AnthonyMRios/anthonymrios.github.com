## What do I do?
Broadly speaking, my primary research interests involve biomedical and social applications of natural language processing.


## Public-Health, Social Media, and Bias

Social media platforms, such as Twitter, are used for many health-related applications, including, but not limited to, the early detection of disease outbreaks, monitoring adverse drug reactions, behavioral risk surveillance (such as monitoring smoking/drug use), and mining individuals mental and physical health.  While many systems have achieved high overall accuracy, it is not enough to decide whether to deploy the systems into production or to use the predictions for public health-related policy development. If a system is evaluated on the racial majority, it may achieve 90% accuracy. However, the performance on underrepresented groups may be much lower. Unfortunately, evaluating fairness is non-trivial. Many fairness metrics require the demographics to be known, or at least, inferred. It is hard to estimate fairness for groups that do not appear in the training dataset. Moreover, many datasets are not large enough to contain every minority group. Hence, much of my recent work has focused on socia media data, public health, and associated issues of bias and fairness.

## Security and Public Saftey Applications of NLP
My research focuses on the security of AI and the application of AI for enhancing security, addressing critical vulnerabilities and leveraging AI capabilities to improve safety measures. The AI for security involves developing robust detection methods to identify malicious activities, such as state-affiliated trolls infiltrating social media or advanced language models generating misleading content. By integrating novel features grounded in stylometry and human interaction patterns, my work significantly enhances the accuracy and resilience of these systems. Likewise, we have developed systems that can query secruity-related databases (e.g., network traffic) and reason about potential attacks that appeared within the database. In parallel, security for AI explores vulnerabilities in NLP technologies, like text-to-SQL systems, to detect and mitigate threats, which can be used to steal company secrets or prepare SQL injection attacks. Through innovative datasets and frameworks, my research demonstrates how AI can effectively infer critical information and protect data, ultimately enhancing both the security of AI systems and the broader digital security landscape. This dual approach ensures that while AI systems become more secure against threats, they also contribute to more robust security solutions in various domains.

## Biomedical NLP Applications
Language shapes the world we live in. Information is shared among individuals through verbal and written communication, including biomedical information. Doctors write notes describing patient symptoms, medical history, and diagnoses. The notes are used annotated by hospitals for billing purposes, e.g., <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2018/02/naacl"><b>medical coding</b></a>. Scientists write research articles creating new information, including, but not limited to, new <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2017/08/ichi"><b>drug-drug</b></a>, drug-gene, and <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2018/03/bioinformatics-2018"><b>gene-gene</b></a> interactions. On social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, users describe life events giving insight on the users mental and physical health, indicating possible <a href="https://anthonyrios.net/blog/2017/11/smmh"><b>adverse drug events</b></a>, depression, or PTSD. I develop methods that can extract biomedical information from many textual data sources.
