<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science (advised by Dr. Ramakanth Kavuluru) at the University of Kentucky. My research interests are in
machine learning and natural language processing, specifically large-scale
multi-label classification, information extraction, and general text classification methods.</p>
